      <h2>Saturday Market</h2>
      <h3>January 7th</h3>
      <strong class="opening-line">On Saturday, Dilara took us to the market.</strong>
      <p>It is a wonderfully eclectic mix of goods from all over the world - delightfully random. I dusted off my bargaining skills to buy a metal bracelet with camels on it, and Maggie bought a lapis lazuli necklace from Afghanistan. In the evening, we walked along Gulf Road towards the marina, passed through Marina Mall, and ate dinner at a wonderful little cafe that we will definitely be frequenting. Ive developed a slight obsession with lentil soul... maybe its because I miss Focos Indian lentil chili.</p>

      <p>We took a catamaran from the marina to Failaka Island, where we got to explore a bit, relax on the beach, and go swimming. The water in the Gulf is incredibly still; I havent seen a wave yet, and when you look out on the horizon it seems to go forever. Something about the color of the water and maybe the dust in the air make it seem hazier than the Atlantic coast. I have some cool pictures of the city skyline as we returned on the boat.</p>
      <p>That night, I hung out in a cafe with two friends, drinking traditional lemonade with mint. Its delicious; maybe I should send in a flavor suggestion to Morano Gelato? Then we drove around the city for a while. Cruising around is a really valid way to spend the time when a tank of gas costs about seven bucks. </p>

You learned how to size elements on a website relative to other elements on the page.

Let’s review what you learned:

Content on a website can be sized relative to other elements on the page using relative measurements.
The unit of em sizes font relative to the font size of a parent element.
The unit of rem sizes font relative to the font size of a root element. That root element is the <html> element.
Percentages are commonly used to size box-model features, like the width, height, padding, or margin of an element.
When percentages are used to size width and height, child elements will be sized relative to the dimensions of their parent (remember that parent dimensions must first be set).
Percentages can be used to set padding and margin. Horizontal and vertical padding and margin are set relative to the width of a parent element.
The minimum and maximum width of elements can be set using min-width and max-width.
The minimum and maximum height of elements can be set using min-height and max-height.
When the height of an image or video is set, then its width can be set to auto so that the media scales proportionally. Reversing these two properties and values will also achieve the same result.
A background image of an HTML element will scale proportionally when its background-size property is set to cover.
Relative units of measurement are a first step towards incorporating responsive design in a website. When combined with more advanced responsive techniques, you can create a seamless user experience regardless of a device’s screen size.
